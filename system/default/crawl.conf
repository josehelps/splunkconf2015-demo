# DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE!
# Changes to default files will be lost on update and are difficult to
# manage and support.
#
# Please make any changes to system defaults by overriding them in
# apps or $SPLUNK_HOME/etc/system/local  
# (See "Configuration file precedence" in the web documentation).
#
# To override a specific setting, copy the name of the stanza and
# setting to the file where you wish to override it.

# Crawl Configuration
#
# Set of attribute-values used by crawl.  
# 
# If attribute, ends in _list, the form is:
#
#      attr = val, val, val, etc.
#
# The space after the comma is necessary, so that "," can be used, as in BAD_FILE_PATTERNS's use of "*,v"
# Whitespace is stripped away and comments, such as this, are on lines that start with "#"
